    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a conceptual framework used to quantify the efficiency of algorithms in terms of the time they require to complete as a function of the input size. It's a critical metric for evaluating how scalable and efficient an algorithm is under various conditions.</p>
    <p>The concept of <b>Space Complexity</b> is pivotal in assessing the amount of memory an algorithm needs to execute successfully. Particularly for large datasets, maintaining a low Space Complexity, often symbolized as O(n), is essential for optimizing resource consumption and ensuring efficiency.</p>
